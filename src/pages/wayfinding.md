## The Workflow
Upon confirming your session, you'll receive a survey beforehand. This survey primes our discussion, enabling us to make the most of our collaborative time.

Throughout our exploratory session, we'll delve into what prompted your current issues, your focal points, constraints, and other pertinent aspects. Notably, our conversation will solely revolve around gathering insights -- no immediate recommendations will be provided during the call. 

Following the session, expect a detailed report within about a week. This report will encompass three potential avenues forward, amalgamating insights from your survey, our session, internal expertise, and any supplementary research.

Our Wayfinding Workshop acts as a springboard for conquering substantial technical challenges.

## Cost 
This service costs one flat transparent fee of $2400.

Each session accommodates a maximum of two participants from your organization. We can center our focus on a specific issue or adopt a broader perspective to comprehend the entire landscape. Should your project involve extensive analysis, more stakeholders, additional time, multiple challenges, and/or heightened research needs, please don't hesitate to get in touch. We'll be pleased to provide a tailored estimate.
